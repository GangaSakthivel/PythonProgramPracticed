# Day 1 Practice - Python Basics

# Question 1: What is your name and age?
name = "Ganga"
age = 23
print(name, "is", age, "years old")

# Question 2: What are the basic data types in Python?
# Answer: int, float, string, boolean

# Question 3: Type conversion example
var = 3.14
to_int = int(var)
print(to_int)  # Output: 3

from_int = 100
to_str = str(from_int)
print(to_str)  # Output: '100'

# Question 4: Performing simple arithmetic
x = 25
y = 5
print(x + 5)  # Output: 30

# Question 5: Operations with integers and floats
x = 10
y = 4
print(x // y)  # Output: 2 (floor division)
print(x % y)   # Output: 2 (modulo)

# Question 6: String manipulation
message = "Hello, Python!"
print(message.upper())  # Output: 'HELLO, PYTHON!'
